## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Here is Wendler Eis!

I would call this file as `README.yard`. Maybe you got thinking _"what is .yard tho?"_. It stands for **Yet Another React Developer!**

I am a brazillian developer from SÃ£o Paulo. I am currently working at @gympass as frontend engineer. I have a bachelor degree in information systems.
